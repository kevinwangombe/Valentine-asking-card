### The Interactive Experience
1. Initial View: Users see a beautifully designed Valentine's card with the question and two response buttons.
2. Clicking "YES! 💖":
   - Celebration animation with confetti
   - Happy sound effects play
   - Joyful message appears
   - Hearts pulse with excitement
3. Clicking "No":
   - The button becomes "slippery" and moves around
   - Text changes through 10 different persuasive messages
   - The "YES" button grows larger to attract attention
   - Eventually shows a respectful message if "No" is persistently chosen
4. Reset Functionality: A "Ask Again" button lets you restart the experience.
